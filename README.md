# MusicHud
**MusicHUD** is a lightweight mod that aims to appreciate the amazing soundtrack of Minecraft a bit more. It displays a popup with **"Now Playing:"** whenever a new song starts playing in-game, so you always know what the song currently playing is.

## Features
You can set **custom titles** for non-vanilla songs by adding them to **en_us.json:**
```
{
  "subtitles.music/game/customm": "CUSTOM NAME TEST"
}
```
## Note
This mod is in its **early stages** yet, so not many versions and platforms are supported.
I promise more is **coming**!
## Setup
Put the `.jar` file into your **mods folder**.

**Start** the game!
